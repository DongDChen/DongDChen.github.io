Graph Convolutional Neural Network Learning （2017 – 2019）
===


•	Proposed a novel graph convolutional neural network architecture based on depth-based representation of graph structure deriving from quantum walks.
•	Proposed a novel graph convolutional auto-encoder architecture that integrates the global topological structure and local connectivity information within a graph.
•	Two papers accepted by Pattern Recognition (PR).
Motif-based Graph Representation Learning	2019 – 2021
•	Proposed a theoretical basis for motif-based graph representation learning, which derived novel measurement quantities by mapping the graph motifs into clusters in the thermodynamic system.
•	Extended motif-based representations into directed graph field, and validated in anomaly detection for the stock market.
•	One paper accepted by PR; One paper accepted by Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS).
Graph Representation Learning in Computer Vision	2021 – 2023
•	Proposed a position-aware embedding network based on subgraphs for graph matching, which combined relative position information at the node level and high-order structural arrangement information at subgraph level.
•	Proposed a centerline graph network for aneurysm global localization, which promoted the downstream local aneurysm segmentation.
•	One paper accepted by PR; One paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI) and currently in minor revision.
